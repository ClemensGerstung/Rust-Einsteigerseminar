Welcome to the Rust course for beginners and newcomers!

Rust is a language that combines efficiency, security and speed. It offers developers the ability to write powerful and reliable software without having to worry about common pitfalls such as memory safety vulnerabilities or concurrency issues that are common in other systems programming languages such as C++.

This course is designed for anyone who wants to delve into the world of Rust. For beginners, the course provides a gentle introduction to the concepts of systems programming and the basics of Rust. For those switching from languages such as C++, this course offers a structured transition that takes existing knowledge and places it in the context of Rust.
